Assignment: Portfolio Website Development using React Routing
Note: If needed take the reference of the portfolio mini project you have implemented in web fundamentals

Intermediate Task:
Develop a portfolio website using React Routing that consists of the following components:

1. Home Page: This page should display an introduction about yourself, including your name, a brief description, and a profile picture.
2. Projects Page: This page should list your previous projects or works. Each project should have a title, a short description, and an image. Clicking on a project should navigate to a detailed project page.
3. Contact Page: This page should provide a form where visitors can send you a message. The form should include fields for name, email, subject, and message. Upon submitting the form, display a success message.
4. Skills Page: This page should provide list of skills you have.

Requirements:
1. Use React and React Router for developing the website.
2. Create separate components for each page (Home, Projects, Contact).
3. Implement routing so that clicking on different navigation links should navigate to the corresponding pages.
4. Use CSS or CSS frameworks (like Bootstrap) to style the website and make it visually appealing.
5. Make sure the website is responsive and looks good on different screen sizes.

Advanced Task:
Add an advanced feature to your portfolio website by implementing dynamic routing:

4. Blog Page: Create a blog page that displays a list of blog posts. Each blog post should have a title, a short preview, a date, and an image. Clicking on a blog post should navigate to a detailed blog post page.

Additional Requirements for Advanced Task:
1. Create a separate component for the Blog page and another component for the individual Blog post page.
2. Use dynamic routing to pass the blog post ID or slug as a parameter in the URL.
3. Implement a data source (e.g., JSON file or API) to fetch and display the blog posts dynamically.
4. Use React state or a state management library (e.g., Redux) to manage the blog data.

Note: You are free to add any additional features or customize the design to make your portfolio website more unique and impressive. Remember to ensure code readability, use best practices, and provide proper comments to explain your code.

Submission Guidelines: 
Note: Ensure your code is well-structured, properly commented, and follows best practices for code quality and readability, including Redux-specific guidelines.
Best coding practices & guidelines should be followed from here: [React Best Coding practices](https://github.com/imranmd/ReactBestPracticesAndGuidelines/)
Best of luck, and happy coding!
