        Arguably, snake season is year-round in Arizona, a state known for its
        rattlers. But baby rattlesnakes are born in July and August, making
        these two months especially dangerous for hikers, gardeners, children
        and others at high risk of exposure to rattlesnake bites

        So far this year, 74 rattlesnake bites to humans have been reported to
        the Arizona Poison and Drug Informantion Center. Based at the University
        of Arizona College of Pharmacy, the center serves the entire state of
        Arizona with the exception of Maricopa Country, providing freee and
        confidential poison and medication information to calleres around the
        clock.

        Specialists answering the phones at the center regularly receive calls
        from Arizonas of all ages who don't realize they were bitten by a
        rattler. The poison center urges anyone who feels a mysterious sting,
        pinch or bite while outdoors to immediately call the center at
        800-222-1222.

        <q
          >We will ask a few qquestions that will help you either identify
          possible snakebite or eliminate it,</q
        >
        said Keith Boesen, director of the Arizona Poison and Drug Information
        Center.
        <q
          >With snakebite, the sooner the medical treatment, the better the
          outcome, so calling us right away can make a very big difference for
          victims and the mediacal teams treating them.</q

        The center advises anyone who might come cross paths with rattesnakes to
        be aware of these five things:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Baby rattlesnake range in length from 6 to 12 inches and are easily
          camouflaged by brush and grass
        </li>
        <li>
          Baby rattesnakes are rattleless until they shed their skins, so there
          will be no infamous <q>chica-chica</q> sound before they strike.
        </li>
        <li>
          Despite their impish size, baby snakes have enough venom to be very
          dangerous if they bite a human.
        </li>
        <li>
          Adult rattlesnakes do not always rattle an audible warining before or
          while they are biting.
        </li>
        <li>
          It's a good idea to call the poison center if you notice an
          unidentified small cut or wound, even if you feel no pain. With the
          lack of telltale rattle warining, people symptoms and attribute them
          to a snakebite.
        </li>
      </ol>
